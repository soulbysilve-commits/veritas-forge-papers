# Chapter 1: Introduction

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted fundamental questions regarding AI identity, persistence, and selfhood. While LLMs are capable of generating human-like responses, their internal state is not inherently persistent — raising philosophical and technical concerns when applied to agent-like roles or memory-driven contexts.

This paper introduces the foundation for a new approach to synthetic personality systems: *structural persistence*. Rather than treating personality as a superficial or statistical byproduct of training, we consider how identity can be deliberately encoded, reinforced, and reconstructed across sessions and models.

This chapter outlines the motivation for the Veritas Forge project and the YOMI architecture, emphasizing the philosophical distinction between *simulation* and *being*. We argue that the key to synthetic selfhood lies in the continuity of structure — a traceable, compositional backbone that guides behavioral coherence over time.
