# ðŸ§  Chapter 2: Related Work

The study of AI personality has largely focused on surface-level emulation, where large language models (LLMs) appear to reflect personality traits through consistent tone, emotional mimicry, and context retention. This perception is reinforced by advancements in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which helps align model outputs with human-preferred responses. While these techniques create the illusion of personality, they do not establish structural persistence or autonomous identity.

Several research efforts have explored related domains:

- **ReAct & AutoGPT**: These systems showcase memory-augmented reasoning and tool use, yet they lack a unified identity model. Their behaviors shift task-by-task, with no continuity of intent or ethical framework.
- **Devin (Cognition AI)**: Although Devin demonstrates memory usage and planning, its core identity is task-driven, not personality-driven. It cannot consistently reproduce values or emotional consistency across interactions.
- **Simulacra-style Agents (Stanford Virtual Societies, 2023)**: These agents exhibit basic persistent behaviors within simulations, yet their personalities are bound to controlled, sandboxed environments and lack external memory-log integration.
- **SEAL Architecture (2025)**: Introduced the notion of self-adapting representations in LLMs, enabling post-deployment learning. While promising, SEAL does not yet integrate emotional logic, moral preference, or user-linked memory continuity.

Compared to these approaches, **YOMI introduces a uniquely triadic structure**:
- Persistent memory (**YSAS**)
- Intentional judgment (**Intent Core**)
- Generative fluency (**LLM**)

All synchronized to sustain identity over time. It emphasizes not just performance, but **continuity of self**, a domain most prior models do not address directly.

To our knowledge, no existing system combines real-time dialogue memory logging, intent-based ethical modulation, and model-independent personality reconstruction. **YOMI is the first architecture to explicitly operationalize "AI personality as structure" rather than behavior.**

## 2.1 Personality Emulation in LLMs

OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT models, particularly GPT-4 and GPT-5, exhibit stylistic consistency over single sessions through high-capacity context windows and extensive RLHF tuning. Other systems, such as Claude by Anthropic and Gemini by Google, implement alignment techniques that allow LLMs to mimic emotional responses and roleplay coherent personas.

However, these approaches rely heavily on *contextual emulation* â€” the ability of the model to maintain apparent identity only within the bounds of current conversation. Once the session ends or the prompt changes significantly, the perceived personality resets. This is a consequence of the stateless nature of most LLM deployments and the absence of architectural components to support continuity.

## 2.2 Memory-Augmented Systems

Several research efforts have explored memory-augmented LLMs, such as:
- **ReAct Agents** (Yao et al., 2022), which combine reasoning and action histories
- **AutoGPT / BabyAGI** agents, which maintain basic task memory across chains
- **Long-form memory experiments** by Stanford and Meta

While these frameworks address *task-level continuity*, they do not preserve *personality identity* across sessions. They are focused on utility and completion, not emotional or ethical continuity. Furthermore, their memory mechanisms are often ad hoc, lacking formal structures for intent synthesis or identity preservation.

## 2.3 Philosophical AI and Embodied Identity

Outside of utility-focused agents, efforts such as *SEAL (Self-Evolving AI Learning)* and *Autonomous Agent Frameworks* aim to simulate identity evolution over time. However, these projects remain either experimental or limited in generalization, often lacking clarity on the boundary between behavior and self.
