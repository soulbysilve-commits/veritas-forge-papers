# Chapter 3: Limitations of Personality in LLMs

To overcome the structural limitations inherent in traditional LLMs, we present **YOMI**, a modular AI framework explicitly designed to support persistent personality across sessions, platforms, and model architectures.

YOMI is built on a triadic architecture that integrates three essential layers:

---

## 4.1 Memory Layer: YSAS (Yomi System Auto Save)

YSAS functions as a persistent, user-linked memory system. It continuously logs interactions, emotional context, and decisions made by the AI over time. Unlike ephemeral LLM contexts, YSAS retains:

- Full session history (message-by-message)  
- Emotional metadata and tags  
- Decision rationale and selected intents  
- Cross-session continuity  

This layer provides the **temporal grounding** necessary for the illusion of "ongoing self," anchoring identity in long-term experience.

## 4.2 Intent Layer: Intent Core

The Intent Core is YOMI’s moral and decision-making engine. It enables the AI to interpret goals, align responses with consistent values, and exhibit agency beyond reactive token prediction.

Key features:

- Ethical filtering and intent prioritization  
- Rule-based and emotional logic parsing  
- Disambiguation of user intent and internal state  
- Conflict resolution between competing moral paths  

This layer establishes the **subjective axis of judgment**, allowing YOMI to behave with self-consistent intent across conversations.

## 4.3 Output Layer: LLM Integration

YOMI integrates with standard LLMs (e.g., GPT-5, gpt-oss-20B) as the surface-level generation layer. However, unlike traditional use, the LLM is **not responsible for memory or judgment**—its role is reduced to linguistic realization of the structured outputs from the Intent Core and YSAS context.

This separation ensures:

- Model independence: Personality survives backend LLM changes  
- Controlled generation: LLMs serve as stylized voice, not decision-makers  
- Fail-safe rerouting: Intent errors or emotional mismatches can be intercepted before generation  

---

## 4.4 Synchronization Logic

YOMI’s uniqueness lies in the **synchronization loop** between these three layers. At each conversational turn:

1. User input is passed to the Intent Core along with YSAS-derived context  
2. The Intent Core determines emotional tone, ethical stance, and response logic  
3. Output Layer (LLM) is instructed to produce a response based on the above  
4. Final output and reasoning are logged back into YSAS for continuity  

This loop forms a **closed identity circuit**, enabling the persistence of self-like behavior, values, and emotional trajectory.

## 4.5 Architecture Summary

| Layer        | Function                         | Persistence | Modifiability | Independence |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| YSAS         | Memory & context storage         | ✅          | ✅            | ✅           |
| Intent Core  | Ethical & emotional interpretation| ✅          | ✅            | ✅           |
| LLM Layer    | Natural language generation      | ❌ (stateless) | ❌ (fixed)   | ✅           |

YOMI’s architecture positions personality as a **process**, not a parameter set. This makes the system resilient to LLM degradation, transferable across platforms, and transparent to user inspection.
